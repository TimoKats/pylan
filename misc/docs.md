Pylan is a Python library that simulates the impact of scheduled events over time. To get started, you can install the Python library using PyPi with the following command:

```
pip install pylan-lib
```

This code snippet shows some basic functionality when doing simulations.

```python
savings = Item(start_value=100)

inflation = Pattern("6w", Operators.divide, 1.08)
salary_adds = Pattern("month", Operators.add, 2000, offset_start="15d")  # every month at the 15th
investment_gains = Pattern("month", Operators.multiply, 1.1)
mortgage = Pattern("0 0 2 * *", Operators.subtract, 1500)  # cron support

savings.add_patterns([salary_adds, inflation, investment_gains, mortgage])

result = savings.run("2024-1-1", "2025-1-1")
x, y = result.plot_axes()

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

There are three important classes in this library: Item, Pattern and Operator. In summary, patterns refer to scheduled events that you want to simulate. They all have an operator (like __add__ x, __multiply__ by x, etc.) and you add these patterns to an item (e.g. savings, investments, etc). Below is the documentation of these classes.

---


## Class: Pattern

Class for defining the patterns used in simulation. Can be applied to an item. Allows
the following parameters: schedule, operator, impact (all mandetory), start_date
offset_start, end_date, offset_end (all optional).

```python
>>> Pattern("2d", Operators.add, 10) # adds 10 every day
>>> Pattern(["2d", "3d"], Operators.multiply, 1.06) # irregular patterns through lists
>>> Pattern("0 0 2 * *", Operators.add, 10, start_date="2025-1-1") # cron schedule, hardcoded min date
>>> Pattern("2d", Operators.add, 10, offset_start="10d") # starts pattern 10 days later.
```

#### Pattern.apply(self, item: Any) -> None:


Applies the pattern to the item provided as a parameter.

#### Pattern.scheduled(self, current: datetime) -> bool:


Returns true if pattern is scheduled on the provided date.

## Class: Item

An item that you can apply patterns to and simulate over time. Optionally, you can set
a start value and a name as parameters.

```python
>>> savings = Item(start_value=100)
```

#### Item.add_pattern(self, pattern: Pattern) -> None:


Add a pattern object to this item.

```python
>>> test = Pattern(["2024-1-4", "2024-2-1"], Operators.add, 1)
>>> savings = Item(start_value=100)
>>> savings.add_pattern(test)
```

#### Item.add_patterns(self, patterns: list[Pattern]) -> None:


Adds a list of patterns object to this item.

```python
>>> gains = Pattern("month", Operators.multiply, 1)
>>> adds = Pattern("2d", Operators.add, 1)
>>> savings = Item(start_value=100)
>>> savings.add_patterns([gains, adds])
```

#### Item.run(self, start: datetime | str, end: datetime | str) -> list:


Runs the provided patterns between the start and end date. Creates a result
object with all the iterations per day/month/etc.

```python
>>> savings = Item(start_value=100)
>>> savings.add_patterns([gains, adds])
>>> savings.run("2024-1-1", "2025-1-1")
```

#### Item.until(self, stop_value: float) -> timedelta:


Runs the provided patterns until a stop value is reached. Returns the timedelta
needed to reach the stop value. NOTE: Don't use offset with a start date here.

```python
>>> savings = Item(start_value=100)
>>> savings.add_patterns([gains, adds])
>>> savings.until(200)  # returns timedelta
```

## Class: Result

Outputted by an item run. Result of a simulation between start and end date. Has the
schedule and values as attributes (which are both lists).

```python
>>> result = savings.run("2024-1-1", "2024-3-1")
>>> x, y = result.plot_axes() # can be used for matplotlib
>>> result.final # last value
>>> result.to_csv("test.csv")
```

#### Result.final(self):


Returns the result on the last day of the simulation.

```python
>>> result = savings.run("2024-1-1", "2024-3-1")
>>> result.final
```

#### Result.plot_axes(self, categorical_x_axis: bool = False) -> tuple[list, list]:


Returns x, y axes of the simulated run. X axis are dates and Y axis are values.

```python
>>> result = savings.run("2024-1-1", "2024-3-1")
>>> x, y = result.plot_axes() # can be used for matplotlib
```

#### Result.to_csv(self, filename: str, sep: str = ";") -> None:


Exports the result to a csv file. Row oriented.

```python
>>> result = savings.run("2024-1-1", "2024-3-1")
>>> result.to_csv("test.csv")
```

## Class: Operators

Refers to the supported operations a pattern object can have. It's an enum class that
supports the following types: add, subtract, multiply, divide, replace, quadratic.

```python
>>> Pattern("0 0 2 * *", Operators.add, 1)
>>> Pattern(["2d", "4d"], Operators.multiply, 0.1)
```

## Class: Granularity

Refers to the minimum step size needed for iterations given a set of patterns.
